                <div class="content">
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence is everywhere. Whether you like it or not, it’s not going anywhere. Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is the latest development in technology that lets computers and machines think, learn, and take actions like human beings. It is essentially the brain in machines that makes them smart enough to solve a problem and perform tasks requiring human intelligence. Chances are, you don’t even realize when you are using or interacting with AI. AI has begun to influence the way people act, perform their job, and relate to the environment. It’s not just a new piece of tech that will be popular for a couple of years and then fade out of popularity; AI is a technology that could reshape how society works. AI can help in several areas such as assisting the physicians in making medical diagnoses, transportation enhancements, and the entertainment industry that recommends specific TV shows to the consumer through marketing strategies. Yet, while AI is incredibly beneficial, it raises significant worries about privacy and ethics, as well as the level of control machines should be allowed to have. The importance of comprehending what AI means and its significance in today’s society cannot be overstated as this advanced technology is becoming an integral aspect of our ordinary lives.</p>
                    <div id="daily-life">
                        <h2>AI in Daily Life</h2>
                        <p>AI is everywhere in our daily routines, even if we don’t notice it. Take your average morning for example. First thing in the morning, you wake up, answer some texts, and spend a couple minutes on social media, whether it be Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok. Believe it or not, you have already used AI three times in the first 5 minutes of waking up. AI helps us unlock our phones with Face ID, it autocorrects our spelling mistakes, and it algorithmically filters our social media to cater to our interests (Marr, 2024). Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa use AI when you ask them the weather, or to play your morning shower playlist. On the road to work, GPS apps rely on AI to guide you with the fastest routes and real-time traffic updates (Tableau (A), n.d.-a). AI even helps with everyday chores, like planning meals or assisting with homework (Paris & Buchanan, 2023). AI has become such a normal part of life that we often take its convenience for granted.</p>
                        <p>Impacts of AI in the workforce are already showing as well. Postings for “Prompt Engineers” have been circulating job websites. The role of a Prompt Engineer is to prompt AI systems like ChatGPT to build content for their company. They are responsible for checking that the chatbot outputs high-quality content, meaning it might take several attempts of input before getting the desired output. This engineering role does not even require a tech degree; those with research or writing backgrounds could thrive in a position such as this one. The biggest shock about this job is the salary. A beginner prompt engineer may earn upwards of $40,000 a year, while an experienced professional may have an annual salary of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-prompt-engineer-jobs-pay-salary-requirements-no-tech-background-2023-3">$375,000</a>.(Nguyen). Which, by the way, is crazy. This is just the beginning of how AI will become infiltrated into all jobs and businesses. It is an extremely powerful tool that everyone must become acclimated to utilizing, or they will fall behind very quickly.</p>
                        <h2>AI in Our Future Daily Lives</h2>
                        <figure class="wrapped-image2">
                            <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Sophia robot">
                            <figcaption>Figure 1. Sophia, the humanoid robot. Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_%28robot%29">Wikipedia</a></figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>In the future, AI will be even more integrated into our lives. By 2030, we might talk to AI systems as easily as we talk to people (Toews, 2024). Robots that look and act like humans could help in homes, schools, and workplaces because they’d be designed to work in spaces built for humans. Everything in our world, from buildings and tools to rooms and doors, has been created by humans and designed to fit our size and shape (Toews, 2024). You may have heard of Roomba, the vacuum robot. If you have seen one, you may have noticed that it can get stuck easily on a rug, a little crack in the floor, or maybe even fall down a flight of stairs. In a world customized for human-sized beings, robots must be designed in the same shape.</p>
                        <p>AI would also be personalized, helping people manage their schedules, hobbies, and health. Imagine AI tools that not only suggest what to cook for dinner but also shop for groceries and prepare meals for you. These advancements could make life much easier, but they also raise important questions about how much we rely on machines and fail to do ordinary human tasks.</p>
                        <h2>Risks of AI in Our Daily Lives</h2>
                        <p>The idea of relying heavily on AI machines isn’t some far-off science fiction—it’s a very realistic part of our future. We’re already seeing it play out in everyday life. Take schools, for example. Students, whether they’re in elementary school or college, often skip studying or procrastinate on assignments because they think, “Why bother? ChatGPT can just do it for me.” It’s a mindset that’s becoming alarmingly common, and it hints at bigger changes AI might bring to the way we live and work.</p>
                        <p>On a larger scale, AI’s potential to outperform humans is undeniable. Robots and automated systems can work faster, more precisely, and without needing salaries, benefits, or breaks. For companies, this makes replacing human workers with machines an incredibly appealing idea. Why pay five employees when one robot can handle their tasks—more efficiently, too? While this might boost profits, it could also lead to widespread job losses, not just in the U.S. but globally. Entire industries could be reshaped, leaving many people struggling to find their place in a workforce dominated by machines.</p>
                        <p>But the impact of AI isn’t just economic—it’s social too. Imagine a world where people are so used to interacting with AI that they lose some of their ability to connect with other humans. Talking to a robot is easy; it doesn’t argue, judge, or reprimand you. But this kind of “safe” interaction might leave people unprepared for real-life conflicts or disagreements. How do you navigate an argument or handle criticism if you’ve only ever communicated with a machine that’s programmed to agree with you?</p>
                        <p>The scariest part? We might not even notice how much we’re relying on AI until it’s too late. Technology is already so ingrained in our daily lives that it’s easy to take it for granted. AI might start off as a helpful tool, but over time, it could become something we depend on for tasks we used to handle ourselves—whether it’s writing a paper, managing a project, or even maintaining relationships.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="transporation">
                        <h2>AI in Transporation</h2>
                        <p>AI is already making transportation safer and easier in many ways. Today, many cars come with features like self-parking, assisted cruise control, and pedestrian detection systems. These tools, assisted by AI, help drivers avoid accidents and make driving more comfortable for people (Kolesnikova, 2024). For example, adaptive cruise control can adjust a car’s speed based on traffic and pedestrian detection warns drivers when someone is crossing the road. AI is also beginning to be put into traffic lights to analyze traffic patterns. These advancements show how AI is actively improving transportation today, making it safer and more convenient for drivers.</p>
                        <h2>AI in Future Transporation</h2>
                        <p>In the future, AI could change transportation in even bigger ways. Self-driving cars are still being tested for many companies, but Tesla has already released a program for a fully self-driving car. All the user has to do is input navigation and keep their hands on the wheel (so that the car knows the driver is awake and alert), and then the car will follow the navigation, adhering to traffic lights, road signs, and pedestrians. AI can also help fix roads before they become dangerous. For example, potholes cost drivers more than $3 billion every year in the U.S., but AI could detect cracks early and alert repair crews to fix them before they get worse (Kolesnikova, 2024). AI could also make traffic flow better by controlling traffic lights. Imagine how much less CO2 would be released from vehicles if there wasn’t so much stopping and starting! Having AI coordinate the traffic lights with the amount of cars on the streets can eliminate so much red light time.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>In a safety sense, think about how quickly an automated computer system can capture the license plate of a car with an abducted child; much quicker than humans can, that’s for sure (Kolesnikova, 2024). Parking could also get easier with AI systems that map out empty spaces in real-time using cameras and sensors, helping drivers find parking spots faster (Kolesnikova, 2024). Fully autonomous vehicles might someday allow people to relax or work while traveling, and parents could even trust these cars to safely take their kids to school. These changes, along with major updates to traffic laws, could make transportation faster, safer, and more environmentally friendly.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) has plans as to how to safely incorporate AI into travel. On their website, they state that they view AI as a promising tool to help enforce safety in transportation. Their three goals for automated vehicles are to promote collaboration and transparency, modernize the regulatory environment, and prepare the transportation system. They also created the “Automated Vehicles Comprehensive Plan” in January of 2021 (U.S. DOT). But this plan would not just be for cars; this plan would automate trains, buses, and aircraft systems. Overnight packages could become the standard shipping option!</p>
                        <h2>Risks of AI in Transporation</h2>
                        <p>One problem with self-driving cars is the aggression factor. In a rush or in traffic, you may cut in front of dozens of cars and aggressively cut closer to the front of the line. If all cars became autonomous, they would treat everyone fairly and line up in accordance to who was there first. This is technically “fair”, but in certain situations you may need to get to the front of that line. It is also important to think about emergency vehicles like police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances. How would they get through bumper to bumper traffic? Additionally, if there is an exit you need to take four lanes to your right, and there are too many other vehicles in the other lanes to merge safely, the car will continue straight and reroute the navigation. This can add minutes to one’s destination ETA, which could be extremely frustrating. The benefit is to be able to make good of the time spent in the car. A fully autonomous vehicle could drive on its own allowing you to spend time working, or on a meeting call.</p>

                    <div id="healthcare">
                        <h2>AI in Healthcare</h2>
                        <p>Artificial intelligence is shaking up healthcare in ways that used to feel straight out of a sci-fi movie. From diagnosing diseases to handling the boring admin stuff, AI is proving it’s here to stay. Take radiologists, for example—they’ve been using AI for years now to catch things like aneurysms and pulmonary embolisms faster and more accurately. These tools don’t just save lives; they also save a ton of time. AI can even measure tumor sizes or analyze CT scans in seconds, making the whole process way more efficient (Theator, 2023).</p>
                        <p>But it doesn’t stop there. AI is completely changing how doctors handle paperwork, which is honestly one of their least favorite parts of the job. Picture this: a tool that listens in on a conversation between a doctor and a patient and then spits out a perfectly detailed clinical report. No more typing away for hours! That means doctors can spend less time buried in charts and more time actually helping people.</p>
                        <p>AI is also becoming a game-changer when it comes to real-time patient monitoring. It can track vital signs and spot patterns that might mean something’s wrong—sometimes before anyone even notices. And it’s not just for hospitals anymore. These tools are starting to pop up in homes, giving patients more control over their own health. Imagine knowing about a potential issue before it becomes a full-blown emergency. That’s where we’re headed.</p>
                        <p>Then there’s AI’s knack for sifting through massive piles of data. It’s being used to predict the early signs of diseases like cancer, which means doctors can step in sooner and improve outcomes. In the operating room, AI is helping surgeons by pulling out key moments from hours of footage, so they don’t have to sit through a full replay. Talk about a time-saver (Johnson & Johnson, 2024).</p>
                        <p>Now, let’s clear up one thing—AI isn’t going to replace doctors anytime soon. You’re not about to book an appointment with a robot instead of a real person. But it is helping doctors make smarter, quicker decisions, and it’s streamlining the whole process. AI is like the ultimate sidekick in healthcare, making things faster, smarter, and more personalized. The future is bright, and it’s looking pretty tech-savvy, too.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.jnj.com/innovation/artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare?&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GO-USA-ENG-PS-Corporate+Equity-GP-EX-RN-NB_STORIES_ARTIFICIAL+INTELLIGENCE&utm_content=AI+-+Healthcare&utm_term=ai+use+in+healthcare&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA0fu5BhDQARIsAMXUBOJqxnvQlDmbbYNl3N28EH_U03L3vxK-lkyId2HYYVtDBCgpQ0KBf64aAkOREALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Johnson & Johnson</a> has employed AI in innovative ways to enhance healthcare. For instance, they produced AI devices that are not only FDA-approved but can be utilized effectively in surgical theaters and cancer detection as well. These devices usher in a new era in medical technology. For instance, AI can capture the most critical aspects of surgeries which would otherwise take up weeks of work into just a few days. This allows doctors to get an understanding of their tasks as further AI learning will increase AI assistance in the future. In addition, AI can assist in identifying the underlying factors of some illnesses through vast amounts of medical information that require scouring. This speeds up looking for other potential cures or medications. Johnson & Johnson has implemented intelligent AI systems as well to avoid delays in treatment or medicine, and even when extreme weather or other factors would occupy this time (Johnson & Johnson, 2024). Thanks to AI, more people have access to precise and rapid healthcare.</p>
                        <h2>AI in Future Healthcare</h2>
                        <p>Artificial intelligence is becoming a transformative tool in healthcare, assisting with complex tasks that traditionally require significant time and effort from human professionals. While AI cannot yet replace doctors and nurses due to its lack of "common sense," "clinical intuition," and experiential knowledge, it is proving invaluable for analyzing vast datasets and handling repetitive, time-consuming tasks (Bajwa et al., 2021). For instance, AI can quickly process large amounts of medical information, identifying patterns or potential solutions faster and more accurately than a human could manage alone. This capacity not only enhances efficiency but also aids in early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Looking to the future, healthcare is anticipated to transition from a "one-size-fits-all" model to a more personalized, precision-based approach. AI is positioned to play a pivotal role in this shift by enabling the creation of customized treatment plans tailored to each patient’s unique genetic makeup, medical history, and lifestyle factors. This individualized care could lead to more effective treatments, better patient outcomes, and potentially lower healthcare costs. For instance, AI might assist in designing therapies that target specific mutations in cancer patients or optimize medication dosages for individuals based on their unique biological profiles.</p>
                        <p>AI also holds the potential to revolutionize preventive care. By analyzing data from wearable devices, electronic health records, and other sources, AI systems could predict and even prevent illnesses before they develop. These tools might monitor vital signs, detect irregularities, and alert healthcare providers to intervene early. For example, AI-powered algorithms could predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on subtle changes in a patient’s biometrics, allowing for timely intervention (Bajwa et al., 2021).</p>
                        <p>In addition to improving clinical care, AI has the potential to enhance operational efficiency in healthcare systems. Automated scheduling, supply chain management, and resource allocation are areas where AI could reduce waste, streamline processes, and save costs. For instance, hospitals could use AI to predict patient admission rates and optimize staffing accordingly, ensuring better service delivery while reducing burnout among healthcare workers.</p>
                        <p>Another promising area is surgical assistance. AI tools are being developed to guide surgeons in real-time, providing critical insights and precision during procedures. These systems can analyze imaging data, identify anatomical structures, and even suggest the best course of action, thereby reducing risks and improving surgical outcomes.</p>
                        <h2>Risks of AI in Healthcare</h2>
                        <p>However, the widespread adoption of AI in healthcare also raises important ethical and practical considerations. Ensuring equitable access to AI-powered technologies will be critical to avoid widening healthcare disparities. Additionally, robust data security measures must be in place to protect patient information from breaches and misuse. Transparent algorithms and rigorous testing standards are essential to maintain trust and accountability in AI-driven decisions.</p>
                        <p>With these challenges addressed, AI has the potential to make healthcare not only more personalized and effective but also more accessible and inclusive. By enhancing the capabilities of healthcare professionals and enabling more proactive and patient-centered care, AI could redefine the way we approach health and wellness in the years to come (Bajwa et al., 2021).</p>

                        <p>However, these advancements do not come without challenges. The heavy reliance on data collection raises valid concerns about privacy, security, and consent. Who controls this data, and how can we ensure it is used responsibly? Similarly, ethical questions about bias, fairness, and accountability loom large as AI systems take on roles with significant societal impacts. For instance, how do we ensure AI in hiring, healthcare, or law enforcement does not perpetuate inequality? These are not easy questions, but they are essential to address.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, there is the issue of over-reliance on machines. As AI takes on more human-like tasks, from writing papers to driving cars, we must ask ourselves what this means for human skills, creativity, and connection. Are we ready for a world where face-to-face interactions diminish in favor of conversations with intelligent machines? And can we adapt to the widespread changes in jobs and industries that AI will inevitably bring?</p>
                        <p>While AI’s potential is vast, so too are its risks. The key lies in striking a balance—harnessing the benefits of AI while staying vigilant about its challenges.
