                    <p>Artificial Intelligence is everywhere. Whether you like it or not, it’s not going anywhere. Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is the latest development in technology which lets computers and machines think, learn, and take actions like human beings. It is essentially the brain in machines that makes them smart enough to solve a problem and perform tasks requiring human intelligence. Chances are, you don’t even realize when you are using or interacting with AI. AI has begun to influence the way people act, perform their job, and relate to the environment. It’s not just a new piece of tech that will be popular for a couple years and then fade out of popularity; AI is a technology that could reshape how society works. AI can help in several areas such as assisting the physicians in making medical diagnoses, transportation enhancements, and the entertainment industry that recommends specific TV shows to the consumer through marketing strategies. Yet, while AI is incredibly beneficial, it raises significant worries about privacy and ethics, as well as the level of control machines should be allowed to have. The importance of comprehending what AI means and its significance in today’s society cannot be overstated as this advanced technology is becoming an integral aspect of our ordinary lives.</p>

                        <h2>AI in Daily Life</h2>
                        <p>AI is everywhere in our daily routines, even if we don’t notice it. Take your average morning for example. First thing in the morning, you wake up, answer some texts, and spend a couple minutes on social media, whether it be Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok. Believe it or not, you have already used AI three times in the first 5 minutes of waking up. AI helps us unlock our phones with Face ID, it autocorrects our spelling mistakes, and it algorithmically filters our social media to cater to our interests (Marr, 2024).
                            <img src="face-id.png" alt="Face ID" class="wrapped-image1">
                            Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa use AI when you ask them the weather, or to play your morning shower playlist. On the road to work, GPS apps rely on AI to guide you with the fastest routes and real-time traffic updates (Tableau (A), n.d.-a). AI even helps with everyday chores, like planning meals or assisting with homework (Paris & Buchanan, 2023). AI has become such a normal part of life that we often take its convenience for granted.</p>
                        <p>Impacts of AI in the workforce are already showing as well. Postings for “Prompt Engineers” have been circulating job websites. The role of a Prompt Engineer is to prompt AI systems like ChatGPT to build content for their company. They are responsible for checking that the chatbot outputs high-quality content, meaning it might take several attempts of input before getting the desired output. This engineering role does not even require a tech degree; those with research or writing backgrounds could thrive in a position such as this one. The biggest shock about this job is the salary. A beginner prompt engineer may earn upwards of $40,000 a year, while an experienced professional may have an annual salary of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-prompt-engineer-jobs-pay-salary-requirements-no-tech-background-2023-3">$375,000</a>.(Nguyen). Which, by the way, is crazy. This is just the beginning of how AI will become infiltrated into all jobs and businesses. It is an extremely powerful tool that everyone must become acclimated to utilizing, or they will fall behind very quickly.</p>
                        <h2>AI in Our Future Daily Lives</h2>
                        <p>In the future, AI will be even more integrated into our lives. By 2030, we might talk to AI systems as easily as we talk to people (Toews, 2024). Robots that look and act like humans could help in homes, schools, and workplaces because they’d be designed to work in spaces built for humans. Everything in our world, from buildings and tools to rooms and doors, has been created by humans and designed to fit our size and shape (Toews, 2024). You may have heard of Roomba, the vacuum robot. If you have seen one, you may have noticed that it can get stuck easily on a rug, a little crack in the floor, or maybe even fall down a flight of stairs. In a world customized for human-sized beings, robots must be designed the same way. </p>
                        <p>AI would also be personalized, helping people manage their schedules, hobbies, and health. Imagine AI tools that not only suggest what to cook for dinner but also shop for groceries and prepare meals for you. These advancements could make life much easier, but they also raise important questions about how much we rely on machines and fail to do ordinary human tasks.                    </p>
