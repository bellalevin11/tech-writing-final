                    <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is the latest development in technology which lets computers and machines think, learn, and take actions like human beings. It is essentially the brain in machines that makes them smart enough to solve a problem and perform tasks requiring human intelligence. AI has begun to influence the way people act, perform their job, and relate to the environment. It’s not just a new piece of tech that will be popular for a couple years and then fade out of popularity; AI is a technology that could reshape how society works. AI can help in several areas such as assisting the physicians in making medical diagnoses, transportation enhancements, and the entertainment industry that recommends specific TV shows to the consumer through marketing strategies. Yet, while AI is incredibly beneficial, it raises significant worries about privacy and ethics, as well as the level of control machines should be allowed to have. The importance of comprehending what AI means and its significance in today’s society cannot be overstated as this advanced technology is becoming an integral aspect of our ordinary lives.</p>
